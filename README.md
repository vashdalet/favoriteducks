# My ducks / My favorite Ducks

### Description: 
My final project is a web application that allows a user to see funny pictures of ducks. But not only see but save them to user's collection and then to share this collection of pictures with friends (or anyone really) via link.
To make this project work I learnt a lot of things on the way. First of all, I had to get acquainted with a new framework, Svelte. I learned how to adapt the skills that I've got from CS50's section about Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the new environment. And I had to figure out how svelte operates and what tools can it offer to a developer. Next, I learned how to work in Svelte in conjunction with Firebase. I needed Firebase to be able to create a database of users and to deploy my project. I took a short course on Svelte and created my first application using Svelte and Firebase. It included a lot of useful things, like user authorization and cookies, concepts of stores and actions in Svelte etc. But that first project wasn't mine, so I decided to take an idea of application that I once had in mind (when I was just at the beginning of my programming path).
Now I would like to tell about some of the features of this application. To start with, I had to generate userID, assign it to the cookie and save it to the database. Then I needed to learn how to fetch data from the API and then to display it on the page. I also learned how to save the data (in my case it was url to the images) to the database in Firebase and how to get it from it to display in user's collection. I also implemented Tailwind and DaisyUI to style the application as I liked. I created a separate page only for user's collection of images and made possible to copy the link to this page to clipboard, so that it would be easy to send and share with someone.
